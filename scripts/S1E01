How many times have I told you that there�s a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
You haven�t told me! It�s called the wastepaper basket.
Look at that ! Look at that face! People say I�m the best boss.
They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before, you�re hilarious, and you get the best out of us.
� I think that pretty much sums it up I found it at Spencer Gifts.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and type of copier paper.
You know, whether we can supply to them whether they can pay for it and I�m boring myself just talking about this.
He still loves that after seven years! What? Nothing Ok, all right.

Ok since the last meeting, Alan and the board have decided that we can�t justify Scranton branch and the Stafford branch Oh ok� No, Michael don�t panic No no no no this is good, this is fine Michael listen, don�t panic We haven�t made any decisions yet, I�ve spoken to Joshua in Stanford I�ve told him the same as you and it�s up to either you or him to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other Ok no problem This does however mean that there is going to be downsizing Me no wanna hear that Jan, because downsizing is a bitch, it is a real bitch, and I wouldn�t wish that on Joshua�s men, I certainly wouldn�t wish it on my men, or women present company excludedsorry.
is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing? Question: how long do we have to � Oh, Todd Paker, terrific rept, do you mind if I take it? No, go ahead Pac man! Hey, big queen Oh, that�s not appropriate Hey, coming in today? I don�t know what you mean Look, I demanded ask her one question Does the corporate master rape Oh my god! That's so horrifying! Horrible Horrible person! So do you think we can keep�a lid on this for now I don�t want to worry people unnecessarily.
No, absolutely.
Under this regime, it will not leave this office.
So what is downsizing actually mean? Well You guys gotta update your resume, just like I�m doing.
I bet it�s gonna be me, probably.
Yeah, it�ll be you I have an important question for you.
Yes Are you going to engelate on Sunday? Yeah, stop.
That�s ridiculous.
Am I gonna tell them? No I�m not going to tell them, I don�t see the point of that.
As a doctor you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
This is Mister Scott.
Ryan Howard from the temp agency set me down to start today Howard, like Moe Howard, Three Stooges? Right here, my vibe.
Oh Pam, that�s a guy thing Pam.
I�m sort of a student in comedy I�m Hitler, Adolph Hitler I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go.

I like to do illustrations, mostly water color, a few oil pencil.
Jim thinks they�re good.
Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.
Sure, Mr.
Davis, let me call you right back.
Yeah, some just came up, two minutes.
Thank you very much.
Dwight, what are you doing? - What? - What are you doing? Just clearing my desk, I can�t concentrate - It's not on your desk.
- It�s overlapping.
It's all coming over the edge.
One word, two syllables : demarcation.
- You can't do that.
- Why not? Safety violation, I could fall and pierce, and organ.
We'll see This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Downsizing? I have no problem with that.
I have been recommending downsizing since Halpert got here even brought it up on my interview.
I say, bring it on! You just still have messages for yesterday.
Relax everything is under control Yeah, yeah, yeah oh that�s important, right.
Oh, this is so important, I should run to answer it.
What? Come on.
Six million dollars man, Steve Austin, actually that would be a good salary for me don�t you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan: I deserve a raise Don�t we all? I�m sorry? There�s nothing! If you are unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR, ok? Not today, ok? Pam just, be professional.
I think I�m a role model here, I think I garner other people respect.
Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP People I respect, heros of mine, would be Bob Hope, Abraham Lincoln, definitely, Bono, and probably God be the fourth one.
And I just think all those people really helped the world, in so many ways, that it�s, it�s really beyond words.
It�s really uncalculable.
Now, I know there�s some rumors out there, and I just kind want to see�.
I�m assistant regional manager, I should know first.
Assistant to the regional manager.
Ok.
Can you just tell me please? Just a whisper in my ear.
I�m about to tell everybody.
I'm just about to tell exeryone Please, ok.
Do you want me to tell them? You don�t know what it is! Can you tell them, with my permission? I don�t need your Permission granted.
Go ahead Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me, and Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stanford branch or this branch.
I heard they might be closing this branch down, That's just That's just the rumor going around this is my first day I don�t really know.
Yeah, but Michael what if they downsize here? Not gonna happen It could be out of your hands, Michael It won't be out of my hands, Stanley, ok? I promise you that.
Can you promise that? On his mother's grave.
Well yeah it is a promise, and frankly I�m a little bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
It�s just that we need to know Hold on a second, I think Pam wanted to say something, Pam? You had a look that you wanted to ask a question, just then? I was in the meeting with Jan and she did said that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Are you sure about that? Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
Pam, information is power.
So you can't say for sure whether it's gotta to be us or them.
No no, no Stanley, no you did not see me in there with her.
I said, if corporate wants to come in here, and interfere then they�re gonna have to go through me, right? You know, you can go a mess with Josh�s people, but I�m the head of this family, and you ain�t gonna be messing with my children.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know, tonnage price of minal folders? Pam�s favorite flavor of yoghourt, which is mix berry.

Ok, you know what? You can be a witness.
Can you reprimand him please? - How do you know it was me? - It's always you.
- Are you gonna discipline him or not? Ooh discipline, kinky! All right, here�s the deal you guys the thing about practical jokes, is that you have to know when to start, as well as when to stop! And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop pulling Dwight�s personal effects into jello.
Ok, Dwight I�m sorry because, I�ve always been your biggest Flam Nice, that�s the way it is around here You should have put him in custard-y! Yes, new guy! He scores ! Ok that�s great, I guess, what I�m most concerned with is damage to company property.

Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard, right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I am a friend first, and a boss second.
Probably an entertainer third.

Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? No it�s the people.
The "people".
My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17%, or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee.
No, no, no, no.
It was a young Guatemalan guy, a first job in the country, barely spoke English, came to me and said "Mr Scott, would you be the Godfather to my child?" Didn't work out in the end.
We had to let him go.
He sucked.
